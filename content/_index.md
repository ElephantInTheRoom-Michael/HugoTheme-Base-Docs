This Hugo theme is not intended to be used directly as a theme on a site.

It provides a good starting point to build on when creating a theme with common things that can be useful on all Hugo
sites.

# Features

- Defines the baseof.html template with places to integrate content
- Sets up the HTML with good best practices
- Presents the page nicely to users with a fade-in effect when a page loads
- Resets default browser CSS styles to ensure consistent styling across browsers
