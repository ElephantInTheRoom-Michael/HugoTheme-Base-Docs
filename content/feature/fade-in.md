title: 'Fade In'
---

The visibility of pages using this base theme will be initially hidden. After all CSS, images, fonts, and other files
have loaded, the page will become visible with a fast fade-in animation.

If the user has JavaScript disabled, the page will be visible immediately without this effect.

No configuration is required to enable this feature, it will be present on all pages.
