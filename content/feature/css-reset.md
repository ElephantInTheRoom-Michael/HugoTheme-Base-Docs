title: 'CSS Reset'
---

Pages using this theme will have a CSS reset applied to ensure consistent styling across different browsers. This makes
all margins and paddings be set to zero. Themes will be required to set these values.

The box sizing model will be set to border-box. This makes sizing elements easier and more predictable.

No configuration is required to enable this feature, it will be present on all pages.
